🚀 Motivation-Centered Dashboard (Mot-Cent-Dash)
A UX Case Study — Reducing Friction in Everyday Digital Tasks
📌 Overview

Motivation-Centered Dashboard is a UX redesign project based on the problem statement:

“When simple tasks feel too complicated.”

The project focuses on how learning platforms often overwhelm users with cluttered interfaces, long flows, and lack of feedback — causing frustration, loss of motivation, and drop-offs.

This redesign aims to make the experience simpler, clearer, and emotionally supportive, without adding unnecessary features.

**🎯 Problem Statement**

Many digital learning platforms fail not because they lack features, but because:

Simple actions take too many steps

Users receive no sense of progress

Effort goes unacknowledged

Interfaces are designed for systems, not human behavior

As a result, users feel lost, demotivated, or mentally fatigued — even when they want to continue.

👤 Target Users

Students preparing for long-term goals (exams, skills, courses)

Users who struggle with consistency and motivation

Learners who want clarity and quick access, not complexity

🔍 Key Pain Points Identified

No clear visibility of progress

Important content buried under multiple clicks

Long-term goals feel overwhelming

Lack of emotional feedback or acknowledgment
